    Originally forked from the amazing scala-notebook,
    almost entirely refactored for Massive Dataset Analysis using Apache Spark.

    The tool allows performing reproducible analysis with Scala, Apache Spark and more.

    This is achieved through an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala code,
    SQL queries, Markup or even JavaScript in a collaborative manner.

    The Spark is available out of the box, and is simply accessed by the variable sparkContext.
